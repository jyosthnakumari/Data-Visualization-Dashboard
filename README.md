The Data Visualization Dashboard is a web-based tool designed to help users input, analyze, and visualize data dynamically. It allows users to enter categories and values, which are then displayed in a data table and represented graphically through bar and pie charts.The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a simple yet interactive experience without relying on external libraries.

2️⃣ Click "Add Data" – The table updates with the new entry.
3️⃣ Charts are updated automatically based on the values entered.
4️⃣ Users can enter multiple values, and the visualization adjusts dynamically.

📌 Why This Project?
Helps understand basic data analysis and visualization techniques.
